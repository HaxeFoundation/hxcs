# hxcs

[![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/hxcs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/hxcs)

Support library for [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) C# backend.

It contains a build tool that is called by Haxe, discovering and calling the C# compiler on the C# code generated by Haxe. It also contains .NET 2.0, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 core assemblies that contain core .NET types and APIs.

## TODO
 * C# CFFI compatibility: be able to use unmodified .ndlls (though recompilation is needed) from hxcpp and neko in C#

## Dotnet Core Support

The build tool now supports using dotnet CLI to compile the generated C# project,
when the `dotnet` tool is found.

To enable `dotnet` set define: `-D dotnet-core`.

By default, the greatest available sdk is used to build the project.
But, the required sdk can be selected with the `dotnet-core` option:

`-D dotnet-core=6.0` or `-D dotnet-core=7`, etc.

## For Contributors

### Clone Project

Since the hxcs depends on the [build-tool-base] repository (used as a submodule),
cloning the project should include submodules:

`git clone --recurse-submodules [repository-url]`


### Code Structure

* `build-tool`: contains the code which builds the C# projects generated by Haxe;
    * `base`: code which handles the CLI and calls the csharp compiler (submodule linked to the [build-tool-base] repository);
    * `src`: code for the csharp compiler itself. Base package is `compiler.cs`;

### Code Architecture

The `CSharpCompiler` is the facade which call the compilation process.
This process can be divided into the following steps:

* `preprocess`: parse the `input.Data` into `CompilerParameters`
* `compiler selection`: select one of the availables `CsCompiler`s based on specified parameters;
* `compilation`: uses the selected compiler to compile the project.

While the `CsCompiler` interface may be implemented in different ways,
a `CompilerPipeline` implementation is provided which further splits the compilation
process based on the following interfaces:

* `CompilerFinder`: try to find the compiler tool. That is, verify if it's available;
* `EnvironmentConfigurator`: an optional step which may modify the compilation parameters used on next steps;
* `ProjectWriter`: based on the compiler parameters, write a project file (`.csproj`), used on the compilation;
* `ArgumentsGenerator`: generate the arguments used by the compiler tool;
* `CsBuilder`: executes the compiler tool, using the generated arguments;

Two main implementation are provided for these classes:

* **Classic** (`compiler.cs.implementation.classic`): executes the _"classic"_ compilers, i.e., _Mono_ or _Msvc_ compiler tools;
* **Dotnet** (`compiler.cs.implementation.dotnet`): uses the _dotnet_ CLI tool to build the project.

Some classes (in `compiler.cs.implementation.common`) are shared between these implementations, like the `ParametersParser`, `CsProjectGenerator` and `DefaultCsBuilder`.

### Compile build tool and run tests

To compile the build tool, you can call (from root of project directory):
    `haxe build-tool.hxml`

This works as a shortcut to the `build-cs.hxml` script, which needs to be called inside the `build-tool` directory.

Similarly, the tests can be called using the shortcut scripts at the project directory:

`haxe unit-tests.hxml` and `haxe system-test.hxml`

or from the tests directories (`build-tool/tests/unit` and `build-tool/tests/system-test`)
using the munit tool:

`haxelib run munit test -neko`

#### Test dependencies

Before building the tests, it's necessary to install the test dependencies, which can be mady through [haxelib].

Both kinds of tests (unit tests and system tests) depends on [munit] and [hamcrest].
Besides that, the unit tests also depends on the [proxsys] library
which is used as fake implementation to the `compiler.cs.system` layer of the build tool,
allowing to fake and verify system behaviors.

The build-tool itself depends only of the haxe standard library.
